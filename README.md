# My Personal Project: *Automobile Dealership Manager*
## What will the project do?
This application will serve as a virtual multi-brand automobile dealership which keeps track of vehicles in a 
dealership. It lets you add a vehicle to your dealership and add information about its price, features, model, mileage,
usage, body type, color, etc. You can view a listing of the added vehicles and see which of them have been sold. 
Another possible feature could be displaying a roster of vehicles using pictures or objects with specifications
depending on the type of car. 

## Who will use it?
This application could be useful to automobile dealerships or anyone in general who has interest in cars, or someone 
who wants to start or manage a similar business. 

## Why is this project of interest to you?
I have always been fond of cars and how they function. I think this project would be a great opportunity to learn more 
about them and how a business revolving around them works.
